## Hi there

This project is a barebones template I've made so Lily can get some standard html / css done and deploy a decent portfolio website. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). Some quick notes:

* The pages are already made:
    * Home page (page.tsx in the main folder)
    * About
    * Battle Bank
    * BravoCare
    * Woodforest

**Please just use tailwind. Don't use next image. This project shouldn't need any react or special next development, but feel free to do something minimal if needed.**

I know an image modal is required, I'll add in the Radix dialog for it.

Feel free to ping me and ask any q's, but in general just use Tailwind Grid and some flex and it should all work just fine. I've already loaded in the font.

For delivery, send a PR or similar to this repo.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
